# RAG Demo

This repository showcases a full-stack application demonstrating the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model. The application includes:

- **Backend**: Implements the RAG model by combining retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to produce accurate and contextually relevant responses.
- **Frontend**: Provides a web-based interface for users to interact with the RAG model, input queries, and view generated responses along with the retrieved documents.

## Architecture

The following C4 model diagram provides an overview of the architecture used in this project:
