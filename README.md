# RAG Demo

This repository showcases a full-stack application demonstrating the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model. The application includes:

- **Backend**: Implements the RAG model by combining retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to produce accurate and contextually relevant responses.
- **Frontend**: Provides a web-based interface for users to interact with the RAG model, input queries, and view generated responses along with the retrieved documents.

The purpose of this project is to illustrate how the RAG model can be integrated into a complete application, highlighting its capabilities in real-world scenarios.
