# RAG Demo

This repository showcases a full-stack application demonstrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The application includes:

- **RAG pipeline architecture**: A serverless implementation of a RAG pipeline - IaC defined in the `template.yml` AWS SAM template - deployed via GitHub actions.
- **User Interface**: Simple React application provides a web-based interface for users to interact with the system, providing document upload and document query.

The following C4 model diagram provides an overview of the RAG pipeline architecture used in this project:
